/* Here is were we create the prototype function we want to link with the operations.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 * int print_int(int )
 * {
 * }
 *
 * char print_str(char )
 * {
 * }
 *
 * and you will keep going until you create the needed functions ask for.
 *
 * REMEMBER:
 *
 * Betty will not accept more than 5 functions per file or more than 80 lines per file,
 * which ever comes first. So continue with a new file if its gona be more than 5 functions or 80 lines :)
